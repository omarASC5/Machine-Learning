Feature:

In Machine Learning feature means a property of your training data. Or you can say a column name in your training dataset.

Suppose this is your training dataset

Height   Sex   Age
 61.5     M     20
 55.5     F     30
 64.5     M     41
 55.5     F     51
 .     .     .
 .     .     .
 .     .     .
 .     .     .

 Then here Name , Sex and Age are the features.

Label :

The output you get from your model after training it, is called label.

Suppose you fed above dataset to some algorithm and generates a model to predict gender as Male or Female, In the above model you pass features like age, height etc.

So after computing it will return the gender as Male or Female. Thats called a Label
